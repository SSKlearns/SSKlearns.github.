<h2>About Me</h2>

</div>
I'm Sarvesh Shashikumar, a Computer Science Undergrad, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore. I am passionate about artificial intelligence and I am always looking for new ways to apply it to solve real-world problems. I get my tasks done, and I am always up for new opportunities to learn and grow.

### My Interests

I am interested in a wide range of topics in artificial intelligence, including natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision. I am also interested in the ethical implications of AI and I am committed to using AI for good. Also I'm a decent self taught artist, and love anything that keeps me active and healthy. I love travelling and exploring new places. Watching the Aurora Borealis live, tops my bucket list.

### My Skills

I have strong programming skills in Python, Java, and C++. I am also proficient in data structures and algorithms. I am a quick learner and I am always eager to take on new challenges. I love to lead a team for cool projects.

### My Problems

I'm also an expert at the worst job of being a procrastinator. I know that it is a bad habit, but I have a hard time breaking it. I am working on it, though! I have found that setting small goals and breaking down large tasks into smaller ones helps me to stay on track. I also find that working with others can help me to stay motivated.

### My End Goal

I want to use my skills to develop AI systems that can make a positive impact on the world. I also want to help educate others about the potential of AI and its ethical implications. My main motivation is to provide a luxurious life to my family, and get a cool car collection for myself hehe.
